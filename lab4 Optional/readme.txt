Assuming all necesary tools (nodejs, redis, vue-cli etc) are already installed follow these instructions:
1. Start your redis server
2. 'npm i' in backend directory
3. 'npm start' in backend directory
4. now open terminal in vue-frontend directory
5. 'npm i' in vue-frontend directory
6. 'npm run serve' in vue-frontend directory
7. click on the link shown in powershell or commantprompt or console to start testing.
   (Usually runs in "http://localhost:8080/")


Thanks!


I prefer vue over react. Feels easy and organised. It's just a personal opinion. At the end of the day I'm ok with using both.
